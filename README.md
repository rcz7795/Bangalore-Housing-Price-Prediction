## Project Objective:
The objective of the project is to create a machine learning model. We are doing a supervised learning and our aim is to do predictive analysis to predict housing price.

## Data Collection:
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle.

If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Future Scope:
* Use multiple Algorithms
* Optimize Flask app.py
* Update the Front-End
